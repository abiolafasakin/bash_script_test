Linux System Monitor Using Bash

Introduction

In this project, I have created a Linux system monitor using a shell
script. The system monitor will continuously monitor the 
CPU, memory, and disk usage of your Linux system and display the usage 
percentages. If any of the thresholds for CPU, memory, or disk usage are 
exceeded, an alert will be sent. The threshold values are customizable
based on requirements, and new logic can be added to send alerts.
